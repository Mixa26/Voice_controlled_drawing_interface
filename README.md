# Voice_controlled_drawing_interface

A deep neural network that recognizes voice commands embedded into a small user interface.<br>

# App possibilities

There are 5 default controlls ['izbrisi', 'krug', 'kvadrat', 'oboji', 'trougao'](in serbian) or ['clear', 'circle', 'square', 'color', 'triangle'](translation).<br>
The circle, square, triangle commands draw the corresponding shapes. The color command colors the corresponding shapes in a random color.<br>
The clear command clears the screen. There is a "Voice command" button which records input from the microphone for 2s, and then the recognized<br>
action is executed. Keep in mind that the neural network was recognized on my voice samples (11 for each command), so it might not perform good<br>
on you own voice.
